      <h1>My Eha Journey</h1>
   <p> We can't be carved, programmed and displayed,<br />
 As others expected for their dreams collapsed,<br />
Carving done at every part of our life without informed,<br />
<em> <strong>Programming updated every stage of our life that intended, </strong></em><br />
   By political carving, economical programming,nd the display as the developed on going,<br />
<strong>Displayed all over the world what they have achieved,</strong> <br />
 When our time is not in our hands to enjoy,</p>
